Composites should contain 'Composite' in their name (Example: FireActionComposite). It becomes clear that the object is to be used as a composition.

Current task
============

I am currently creating a composite containing position and direction.
Its name is PositionableComposite.

PositionableComposite is used when drawing. The object contains information to position and rotate the object before drawing. It is clearly a common behavior.
